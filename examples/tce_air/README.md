# tce_air: the paper's claims, step by step

This directory checks the main claims of the paper *A rate-preserving
microcanonical total collision energy model for discrete internal states
and detailed-balance reverse reactions* with SPARTA runs on an ordinary
computer.  Each step runs a few small simulations of air chemistry and
compares what SPARTA does with a reference that is computed independently,
from the data files and the formulas of the paper, by `tce_ref.py`.  Every
comparison is printed as a PASS or FAIL line.

It is meant for reviewing the code and the physics.  You need no knowledge
of SPARTA internals: each step is one directory with its input decks
(`in.*`), its run list (`runs.py`) and its analysis (`analyze.py`), and
the analysis says in words what it compares.

## What you need

- A Linux or macOS machine with 4 cores (more is faster), an MPI C++
  compiler (`mpicxx`), `make`, and Python 3 with `numpy`, `scipy` and
  `matplotlib`.
- About 1 hour for all steps with 4 cores.

## Quick start

```bash
cd examples/tce_air
./build.sh                       # builds bin/spa_release from this branch
./tce_air.py run all --jobs 4 --np 1
./tce_air.py analyze all
```

`run` skips runs that already finished, so it can be repeated after an
interruption.  `analyze` writes everything to `results/<step>/` and
returns the number of failed checks.  On a machine with more cores, run
more jobs at a time: `--jobs 6 --np 2` on 12 cores.

Two optional builds add comparisons with earlier treatments:

```bash
./build.sh --compare             # bin/spa_compare: the earlier TCE treatments
./build.sh --precap              # bin/spa_precap: before the cap correction
```

Without them the runs that need them are skipped, and their checks are
left out.

## What each step checks

Each step corresponds to a part of the paper.  The step's `runs.py` lists
its runs, `analyze.py` its checks; `results/<step>/results.txt` has the
outcome.

| step | paper | what is checked |
|---|---|---|
| `step1_rates` | Secs. III-IV, VII A; Figs. 1, 3; Table VI | The equilibrium dissociation rate of O2 + N2 reproduces the input Arrhenius rate with the microcanonical factor, for vibrational, electronic and joint ladders and discrete rotation; the earlier treatments (adding electronic energy to the collision energy, leaving it out, instantaneous vibrational DOF) miss it by the amounts the paper derives. |
| `step2_noneq` | Sec. VII B; Figs. 4-6; Table V | With vibrational or electronic populations frozen away from the translational temperature, the rate follows an independent quadrature of the ladder average; comparison with Bird's QK model, Park's two-temperature model and QCT data for N2 + N2. |
| `step3_balance` | Secs. V, VII C; Fig. 7; Table VII | Derived reverse reactions balance their forward partners: the Zeldovich exchange, three-body recombination with atomic and molecular third bodies, with an equilibrium-constant fit, and the full 11-species mechanism. |
| `step4_box` | Sec. VII C; Fig. 9 | A closed reacting box with the Zeldovich pair relaxes to the equilibrium composition from both sides, thermostatted and adiabatic, and the internal modes of every species stay at the translational temperature. |
| `step5_energy` | Sec. VII D; Table VIII | Total energy is conserved through dense reaction cycling only when reaction energies close around cycles and species masses are conserved; each defect alone makes the energy drift. |
| `step6_noneq_reverse` | Sec. VII E; Table XI | The reverse rate responds to the internal temperature with no cell temperature in the model, mode by mode, and recombination responds to the electronic populations, as the microcanonical tables predict. |
| `step7_cap` | Secs. IV D, VII G; Table X | Where fitted rates exceed the collision rate, the capped forward rate and its reverse follow the capped fraction of the microcanonical probability, and a reacting gas still reaches the partition-function equilibrium. |
| `step8_thermo` | Sec. VII F; Fig. 10 | The equilibrium constants of the data files against the NASA Glenn (CEA) database; no SPARTA runs. |

## Reading the results

`results/<step>/results.txt` lists every check:

```
  [PASS] TV=  300 K microcanonical: 0.538 +/- 0.012, analytic 0.538
```

The measured value carries two standard deviations of its counting
statistics (or of the spread over seeds, if larger); a check passes when
the measurement agrees with the reference within three standard
deviations plus a small allowance stated in the analysis.  Lines without
PASS or FAIL are information (numbers the paper quotes, or values a check
does not need).  Each step also writes its figures (`fig*.pdf`), tables
(`table*.tex`, `.txt`) and `numbers.json`.

The quick size of the package resolves the claims at the few-percent
level.  The paper's numbers come from the same decks at larger sizes,
run on GPUs (the `paper-runs` branch of the paper's repository).

## How the references are computed

`tce_ref.py` reads the data files (`data/air.*`) and implements the
paper's formulas directly: partition functions and equilibrium
constants, the TCE probability and its microcanonical ladder average, the
derived reverse probability with its calibration and the cap at one, and
the three-body recombination average.  It does not call SPARTA or use any
of its tables.  Where the paper says "quadrature", `tce_ref.py` computes
the integral numerically; each reference function also checks itself
against a closed form where one exists (for example, the calibration
constant of a reverse table must not depend on temperature).

## Files

```
build.sh        builds bin/spa_release (and optionally spa_compare, spa_precap)
tce_air.py      list, run and analyze the steps
pkg.py          runs, logs and reports shared by the steps
tce_ref.py      the independent reference calculations
paper_style.py  figure style
stepN_*/        one step: in.* decks, runs.py, analyze.py, data files
results/        written by run and analyze
```

Each run writes `results/<step>/<run>/log.sparta` and `run.json` (how the
run was made); a run whose definition changes is run again.
