/**
 * @brief Cache of images converted to a format that Qt can decode
 *
 * Qt reads only a subset of the image formats that SPARTA and other tools can
 * write.  For the remaining ones (tga, eps, sgi, ...) readImage() shells out to
 * ImageMagick and converts the file to a temporary PNG.  That conversion is
 * expensive, so the PNG is kept and reused: a file is converted at most once,
 * unless it changes on disk.  Cache entries are keyed by the absolute source
 * path and validated against its modification time and size, so a file that is
 * rewritten (a growing dump image sequence, for example) is converted again.
 *
 * An entry therefore exists only for a file that Qt cannot decode, and a fresh
 * entry answers a request without handing the source file to Qt again.  That
 * matters beyond the saved work: several of Qt's image format plugins print a
 * warning for every file they reject (the TGA plugin is a notorious example),
 * which would otherwise be repeated on every single display of the image.  The
 * one unavoidable attempt is made under a QtMessageSilencer, and its output is
 * reported only if ImageMagick cannot rescue the file either.  A file that
 * cannot be read at all is remembered as such, so it is neither converted nor
 * complained about twice.
 *
 * All temporary files live in a single QTemporaryDir that is created on first
 * use and removed, with everything in it, when the cache is destroyed.  The
 * directory also hosts the frames extracted from imported movie files, for
 * which makeSubDir() hands out private subdirectories.
 *
 * The class is not thread-safe and must only be used from the GUI thread.
