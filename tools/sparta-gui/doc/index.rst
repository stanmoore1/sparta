****************
About SPARTA-GUI
****************

SPARTA-GUI is a graphical text editor with syntax highlighting,
auto-completion, inline help, and indentation support for `SPARTA
<https://sparta.github.io/>`_ input files.  It is programmed using the `Qt
Framework <https://www.qt.io/>`_ and customized for running, monitoring,
and visualizing SPARTA simulations.  It calls SPARTA directly using the
`SPARTA library interface
<https://sparta.github.io/Library.html#sparta-c-library-api>`_ instead of
launching an external SPARTA executable.  Therefore it can retrieve and
display information from SPARTA *while it is running* and *immediately*
display visualizations created by a dump image command in the input.

The primary motivation for implementing SPARTA-GUI is to facilitate
teaching SPARTA to beginners using only SPARTA-GUI and to have a
consistent behavior across major platforms like Linux, macOS, and
Windows.  This way one can focus on teaching SPARTA and avoid having to
spend time explaining different tools (for editing inputs, plotting
graphs, visualizing systems) on the different platforms.  Also,
SPARTA-GUI is fully integrated with a `collection of SPARTA tutorials
<https://spartatutorials.github.io>`_.

Many of the features in SPARTA-GUI are useful beyond working on
tutorials.  For instance, it can streamline the process of prototyping
new simulation projects or debugging misbehaving simulations.  It also
has been found extremely useful in creating, debugging, and tweaking
`advanced visualizations with SPARTA
<https://sparta.github.io/Howto_viz.html>`_ using the built-in
visualization facility of the `dump image command
<https://sparta.github.io/dump_image.html>`_.

About this document
*******************

This document contains the documentation of SPARTA-GUI and how to
compile, install, use, configure, and modify it.  Suggestions for new
features and reports of bugs are always welcome.  You can use the `same
channels as for SPARTA itself
<https://sparta.github.io/Errors_bugs.html>`_ for that purpose or submit
bug reports or pull requests in the `SPARTA-GUI GitHub repository
<https://github.com/akohlmey/sparta-gui>`_.

Citing SPARTA-GUI
*****************

There is currently no citation specifically describing SPARTA-GUI but a
manuscript has been submitted to `JOSS <https://joss.theoj.org/>`_.
Also, starting with version 3.0.0 SPARTA-GUI releases are automatically
archived on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_:

An introduction to SPARTA-GUI is included in the following publication
in LiveCoMS for the SPARTA tutorials that are linked from SPARTA-GUI, so
the suggestion is to cite that publication for now:

Programmer's Guide
******************

This guide provides documentation for developers who want to understand
the internals of SPARTA-GUI or contribute to its development.

.. admonition:: AI Generated Content
   :class: note

   The initial version of the Programmer's Guide section was created by
   the `GitHub Copilot Coding Agent <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot>`_
   and not everything has been carefully checked.  It is therefore
   possible that it contains errors where the LLM has misinterpreted the
   SPARTA-GUI source code.  If you spot any such errors or inconsistencies,
   please submit a bug report issue to point them out or -- even better --
   submit a pull request with the necessary corrections.

   .. admonition:: Web Browser Compatibility

     This website makes use of advanced features present in "modern" web
     browsers.  This leads to incompatibilities with older web browsers
     and specific vendor browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer on Windows)
     where parts of the pages are not rendered as expected (e.g. the
     layout is broken or mathematical expressions not typeset).

     The following web browser versions have been verified to work as
     expected on Linux, macOS, and Windows where available:

     - Safari version 11.1 and later
     - Firefox version 54 and later
     - Chrome version 54 and later
     - Opera version 41 and later
     - Edge version 80 and later

     Also Android version 7.1 and later and iOS version 11 and later have
     been verified to render this website as expected.
