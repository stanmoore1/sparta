Development Guidelines
**********************

Code Style
==========

The project follows these coding conventions:

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Formatting**: Enforced by ``.clang-format`` configuration (LLVM-based)
- **Comments**: Use Doxygen-style documentation comments
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: CamelCase (e.g., ``CodeEditor``, ``ChartWindow``)
  - Qt overrides: camelCase (e.g., ``setFont``, ``eventFilter``)
  - Custom methods/slots: camelCase (e.g., ``stopRun``, ``saveAs``)
  - Members: camelCase (e.g., ``reformatOnReturn``)

Documentation
=============

Added functionality should be documented both in the User's Guide and
the Programmer's Guide section of the documentation.  The documentation
should have suitable ``.. index::`` directives to populate the index
with suitable keywords.  The documentation is written in
`reStructuredText
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
and imports documentation of the source code from `Doxygen
<https://doxygen.nl/>`_ using the `Breathe Sphinx plugin
<https://www.breathe-doc.org>`_.  The documentation should translate
cleanly to `HTML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ and `PDF
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF>`_ using the ``html`` or ``pdf``
build targets.  Additionally the build targets ``spelling`` and
``linkcheck`` are available to run a spell checker on the documentation
and validate external links.

All public classes and functions should have Doxygen documentation as
demonstrated below:

.. code-block:: cpp

   /**
    * @brief Brief description
    *
    * Detailed description if needed
    *
    * @param param1 Description of parameter
    * @return Description of return value
    */
   int myFunction(int param1);

Building
========

See :doc:`installation` for detailed build instructions. For development:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Debug build with Qt6
   cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
         -DSPARTA_GUI_USE_PLUGIN=ON -DBUILD_DOC=OFF
   cmake --build build --parallel 2

Before submitting a pull request, run ``clang-format`` on any modified
source files so they conform to the project's ``.clang-format``
configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   clang-format -i src/*.cpp src/*.h

When adding new ``.cpp`` or ``.h`` files to ``src/``, also add them to
the ``PROJECT_SOURCES`` list in ``cmake/Sources.cmake`` so they are
picked up by the build (Qt's ``AUTOMOC`` handles ``moc`` generation
automatically once the file is listed).  The top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` contains only the configuration options and the
executable target; the remaining build logic is organized into include
files in the ``cmake/`` folder.

All documentation should be written in American English using plain
ASCII characters (no typographic quotes, em-dashes written as ``--``,
etc.).

.. _add_colormap:

Adding or modifying a color map
===============================

.. index:: color map

The dump-image color maps shown in the :ref:`Color Maps tab
<colormaps>` are defined once, as a table in ``src/colormaps.cpp``.  A
single ``ColorMapDef`` -- a ``continuous`` flag plus a list of ``ColorMapStop``
entries (each a position in ``[0,1]`` and either a SPARTA named color or an
explicit RGB triple in ``[0,1]``) -- drives both the ``dump_modify cmap``
command emitted by ``buildCmapArgs()`` (in ``src/dumpimage.cpp``) and the
preview swatch built by ``addColorMapItems()`` (in
``src/imageviewersettings.cpp``), so the two cannot disagree.

To add a color map:

#. Add an entry to the ``maps`` table in ``src/colormaps.cpp``.  Use ``rc(pos,
   r, g, b)`` for an explicit RGB stop (components in ``[0,1]``) or ``nm(pos,
   "name")`` for a SPARTA named color.  Set the ``ColorMapDef`` flag to ``true``
   for an interpolated (continuous) map or ``false`` for a discrete sequence.
   Use the same 0..1 floating-point values that SPARTA renders so the preview
   matches exactly.
#. Add the map's name to ``colorMapNames()`` in the same file, at the position
   where it should appear in the selection menu.
#. Regenerate the documentation preview image and add the new map to the
   color-map list in ``doc/visualization.rst``::

       python3 doc/colormaps_preview.py

#. Optionally extend ``test/test_dumpimage.cpp`` to pin the new map's stops.

Modifying an existing map is just editing its stops in the table; nothing else
needs to change.  Canonical stops for a matplotlib color map can be resampled
with a few lines of Python::

    import matplotlib.cm as cm
    m = cm.get_cmap("cividis")
    n = 5  # number of stops
    print([tuple(round(c, 3) for c in m(i / (n - 1))[:3]) for i in range(n)])

Porting changes from LAMMPS-GUI
===============================

.. index:: upstream
.. index:: LAMMPS-GUI

SPARTA-GUI is derived from `LAMMPS-GUI
<https://github.com/akohlmey/lammps-gui>`_ through a mechanical,
scriptable rename followed by documented SPARTA-specific changes.  The
rename map and script are kept in the ``port/`` folder
(``port/rename.map``, ``port/rename.sh``), and the recipe for porting
improvements from newer upstream LAMMPS-GUI releases is described in
``port/UPSTREAM.md``.  When fixing a bug that is also present in
LAMMPS-GUI, consider submitting the fix upstream as well.

Contributing
============
