   Sync-debugging dual view.

   Kokkos turns off its own coherence state machine whenever the host and device
   device_types match: sync(), modify() and their named variants return
   immediately and the two views share a single allocation.  That is every
   CPU-only build, which is why a missing sync() or modify() -- silent data
   corruption on a GPU -- cannot be observed without one.

   When that happens this class allocates a second buffer for the host side and
   drives the coherence state machine itself, so the host/device edge behaves the
   way it does on a GPU and the same bugs become reproducible on the CPU.  On a
   real GPU backend the two sides are already distinct and everything is
   forwarded to the base class unchanged.

   Constraints this class has to respect:
   - SPARTA styles are copied by value into device functors (see copymode), and
     they hold dual views as members.  So no member may have a non-trivial
     destructor, and the coherence flags live in a Kokkos::View so that copies
     share them by reference -- the same reason Kokkos keeps its own
     modified_flags in a View rather than in plain ints.
   - view<Device>() is callable from device code, so it may not do host-only work.

  // narrower one -- whether the two device_types match -- which is the same
  // answer in every SPARTA build, since SPARTA names one execution space and
  // uses it everywhere.  Ask it of the memory spaces anyway, so that the
  // emulation stays keyed to the thing it is actually emulating.
  //
  // The emulation gives the host side a buffer of its own and moves values
  // between the two with deep_copy, so it can only model element types for
  // which a byte-for-byte duplicate is a second, independent value.  SPARTA has
  // four that are not: struct_tdual_{int,float}_{1d,2d} wrap a dual view, and a
  // dual view of those (particle:eiarray and friends) is exactly the
  // DualView-of-DualView idiom -- grid_custom_kokkos.cpp:196 claims the outer
  // view on the host and syncs it to the device so that device kernels can
  // reach the inner views.  On a GPU the copy lands in device memory, where
  // Kokkos never runs an element destructor; here both sides are HostSpace, so
  // Kokkos destroys the elements of both, and the duplicate's reference-counted
  // handles -- copied as bytes, never incremented -- are decremented a second
  // time.  ASan reports the heap-use-after-free at teardown, which is the
  // emulation's own doing and not a coherence fault.  Leave those pairs

  /* ---- poison mode, SPARTA_KOKKOS_POISON (needs an AddressSanitizer build) ----

     The other detectors intercept the accessors, and a read through a cached
     view or one of the plain SPARTA pointers never calls an accessor.  Poison
     mode enforces the invariant on the memory itself: whichever side of the
     dual view is not the authoritative one has its bytes poisoned, so any
     dereference of stale data -- through an accessor, a cached view, a subview,
     a raw pointer, or a memcpy inside a library -- stops the run at the exact
     instruction with a full AddressSanitizer report.  Fetching a pointer
     without dereferencing it never traps, so the pointer-caching that the
     accessor checks had to be taught to ignore is silent by construction.

     The rule follows the package's own convention: a side may be touched after
     it was synced, after it was claimed, or after clear_sync_state() opted out
     of coherence; touching the stale side without one of those first is the
     bug.  The state is re-derived from the counters at the end of every
     coherence call, and both sides are opened at the start of one so the
     tool's own copies and comparisons never trap.

     Survey mode: build with -fsanitize-recover=address and run with
     ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0 to log every stale access and keep going.

  /* ---- watch mode ---------------------------------------------------------

     SPARTA_KOKKOS_VERIFY only sees a view whose counters call it in sync, and the
     ordinary way to write a dual view -- fill one side, then claim it -- leaves
     the counters saying exactly that for as long as it takes to reach the claim.
     So it cannot tell a forgotten claim from a claim that has not happened yet.

     Watch mode removes the ambiguity by remembering, for the views whose label
     contains SPARTA_KOKKOS_WATCH, what each side held at the previous coherence
     call.  At the next one it compares:

       host differs from its shadow    -> the host side was written since
       device differs from its shadow  -> the device side was written since

     which is a fact about the data and needs no interpretation.  A write is
     legitimate when the counter for that side went up in the meantime, or when
     the call we are entering is the claim for it.  Anything else is a write
     nobody claimed: on a GPU the next sync in that direction silently discards
     it.  The report names the view, the element, both values and the call that
     found it; set SPARTA_KOKKOS_WATCH_BT to add a backtrace, which points straight
     at the routine that needs the claim.

     The shadows are then brought up to date, so one bug is reported once rather

     Watch mode sees a write nobody claimed.  The other half of the bug class is

     the counters are perfectly consistent, the data is simply old.

     Two things keep this from drowning the reader.  A view is also handed out
     immediately before it is copied, and on most of those the two sides already
     hold the same bytes, so nothing would have changed had the copy run first;
     only a difference in the data is worth a word.  And one missing copy is
     read over and over, so each array is named once and counted thereafter,
     with the totals printed when the run ends.

     SPARTA_KOKKOS_STALE takes the text to look for in a name, empty for every
     view; combine with SPARTA_KOKKOS_WATCH_BT for the backtrace of the reader.
