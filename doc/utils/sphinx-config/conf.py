# -- Anchor names ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# docutils builds an HTML id by lowercasing a string and replacing every run
# of non-alphanumerics with a hyphen, so the txt2html anchor "start_7" would
# become "start-7" and "Bird94" would become "bird94".  Those anchor names
# are the manual's URLs -- they are linked to from other pages, from the
# SPARTA web site, and from outside -- so renaming them silently breaks
# inbound links.
#
# All 141 of them are kept by the sources themselves: alongside each
# ".. _Bird94:" label the conversion emitted a raw-HTML
# <span id="Bird94"></span>, which docutils passes through untouched.  Grep
# doc/src for "raw:: html" to see them.
#
# Two other mechanisms for the same job used to live here -- a monkeypatch
# of docutils' make_id and fully_normalize_name, and an anchor_compat
# extension driven by a manifest of the published names.  Removing each in
# turn produced a byte-identical build, so both were dead, and a dormant
# second mechanism is worse than none: nobody would notice it had stopped
# working.  doc/utils/parity-check.py is what actually holds the line, by
# comparing every anchor against the txt2html manual on every run.
