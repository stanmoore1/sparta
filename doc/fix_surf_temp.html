<PRE>fix ID surf/temp surf-ID Nevery source Tsurf emisurf customID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>surf/temp = style name of this fix command 

<LI>surf-ID = group ID for which surface elements to consider 

<LI>Nevery = adjust surface temperature once every Nevery steps 

<LI>source = computeID or fixID 

<PRE>  computeID = c_ID or c_ID[n] for a compute that calculates per surf values
  fixID = f_ID or f_ID[n] for a fix that calculates per surf values 
</PRE>
<LI>Tsurf = initial temperature of surface (temperature units) 

<LI>emisurf = emissivity of the surface (unitless, 0 < emisurf <= 1)  

<LI>customID = name of a custom per-surf variable to create 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 surf all all etot

<P>surf_collide 1 diffuse s_temperature 0.5
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Compute a new temperature for each surface element in the group once
every Nevery steps.  This command uses a compute or fix ID which
should compute the flux of total energy onto each surface elements,
e.g. <I>etot</I> from the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute surf</A> command.  Note
that SPARTA does not check that the compute/fix specified calculates
an energy flux.
</P>
<P>This fix creates a custom per-surf vector with the specified name of
<I>customID</I>.  It can be accessed by other commands which use the
current temperature of surface elements.  An example is the
<A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide diffuse</A> command.
</P>
<P>The per-surface element temperatures computed by this fix can be
output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump surf</A> command, using the <I>s_name</I>
syntax to output the custom temparture variable created by this fix.
See the examples/adjust_temp dir for scripts that use this fix.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>group-ID</I> must be the name of a surface element group,
as defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group surf</A> command, which contains a
set of surface elements.
</P>
<P>The specfied <I>Nevery</I> determines how often the surface temperatures
are re-computed.
</P>
<P>The <I>source</I> can be specified as a per-surf quantity calculated by a
compute, such as the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute surf</A> command.  Or it
can be specified a per-surf quantity calculated by a fix, e.g. one
which performs time-averaging of per-surf quantities, such as <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix
ave/surf</A>.
</P>
<P>If the specified <I>source</I> has no bracketed term appended, the compute
or fix must calculate a per-surf vector.  If <I>c_ID[I]</I> or
<I>f_ID[I]</I> is used, then I must be in the range from 1-M, which will
use the Ith column of the M-column per-surf array calculated by the
compute or fix.
</P>
<P>The temperature of the surface element is calculated from the
Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gray-body, which states that
</P>
<PRE>q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf^4 
</PRE>
<P>where q_wall is the heat flux to the surface (provided by the compute
or fix), sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant appropriate to the
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> being used, <I>emisurf</I> is the surface emissivity,
and <I>Tsurf</I> is the resulting surface temperature.
</P>
<P>The specified emissivity <I>emisurf</I> is a unitless coefficient > 0.0 and
<= 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.  An emissivity
coefficient of 1.0 means the surface is a black-body that radiates all
the energy it receives.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>Tsurf</I> value is used to set the initial temperature of
every surface element in the system.  The temperature values for only
surface elements in the <I>surf-ID</I> group will be reset every <I>Nevery</I>
timesteps by the formula above.  The the temperature values for
surfaces not in the <I>surf-ID</I> group will always be <I>Tsurf</I>.
</P>
<P>Note that these temperature values are stored in a custom per-surf
vector.  The commands that use these values determine whether they
access only surface element values in the <I>surf-ID</I> group or others as
well.  E.g. the <A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide diffuse</A> command can
also be assigned to a group of surface elements via the
<A HREF = "surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A> command.  If the same surface group ID
and same custom per-surf vector name is used for both surf_collide
diffuse and this command, then only surface elements with time-varying
temperatures set by this fix will be accessed for surface collision
calculations.
</P>
<P>It is also possible to defined multiple <A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide
diffuse</A> and fix surf/temp commands could be
defined, each pair of which use a different surface group and
different custom per-surf vector name.
</P>

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix writes its per-surf temperatures values to the restart file.
If the restart input script defines this fix after a restart file has
been read, the temperature values should be set to the restart file
values.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Currently this fix can only be used in simulations that define
explicit non-distributed surfaces.  Support for distributed or
implicit surfaces may be added at a later time.
