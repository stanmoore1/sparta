<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>global fnum 1.0e20
global vstream 100.0 0 0 fnum 5.0e18
global temp 1000
global weight cell radius 
global mem/limit 100 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define global properties of the system.
</P>
<P>The <I>fnum</I> keyword sets the ratio of real, physical molecules to
simulation particles.  E.g. a value of 1.0e20 means that one particle
in the simulation represents 1.0e20 molecules of the particle species.
</P>
<P>The <I>nrho</I> keyword sets the number density of the background gas.  For
3d simulations the units are #/volume.  For 2d, the units are
effectively #/area since the z dimension is treated as having a length
of 1.0.
</P>
<P>Assuming your simulation is populated by particles from the background
gas, the <I>fnum</I> and <I>nrho</I> settings can determine how many particles
will be present in your simulation, when using the
<A HREF = "create_particles.html">create_particles</A> or <A HREF = "fix_emit_face.html">fix
emit</A> command variants.
</P>
<P>The <I>vstream</I> keyword sets the streaming velocity of the background
gas.
</P>
<P>The <I>temp</I> keyword sets the thermal temperature of the background gas.
This is a Gaussian velocity distribution superposed on top of the
streaming velocity.
</P>
<P>The <I>gravity</I> keyword sets an acceleration term which is included in
the motion of particles.  The magnitude of gravity is set by the <I>mag</I>
keyword.  Its direction of action is set as (ex,ex,ez).  The direction
does not have to be a unit vector.  If the magnitude is set to 0.0, no
acceleration term is included, which is the default.
</P>
<P>The <I>surfmax</I> keyword determines the maximum number of surface
elements (lines in 2d, triangles in 3d) that can overlap a single grid
cell.  The default is 100, which should be large enough for any
simulation, unless you define very coarse grid cells (relative to the
size of surface elements).
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>surfpush</I> keyword is only useful to use when SPARTA is having
problems embedding a surface in the simulation grid, which occurs when
when surface elements are defined via the <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A>
command.  Or for debugging purposes.
</P>
<P>In rare cases, if a surface element point is just slightly inside or
outside a grid cell, but within an epsilon distance from the surface
of the grid cell, a numerical round-off error can occur when computing
the cut volume.  The error can be avoided if such points are shifted
(pushed) to a slightly different location, which only induces a tiny
change in the computed cut volume.  By default the <I>surfpush</I> keyword
is set to <I>yes</I>, which will perform this "push" operation on a grid
cell if the numerical issue is flagged.  SPARTA prints out how many
grid cells needed this push operation.
</P>
<P>If you set <I>surfpush</I> to <I>no</I>, then the push operation is not
performed, which will result in an error if the numerical issue
occurs.
</P>
<P>If the default <I>surfpush yes</I> still gives an error, then
setting the <I>slo</I>, <I>shi</I>, and <I>svalue</I> allows experimentation
with a different mode of pushing.
</P>
<P>These 3 values are all multipliers on an epsilon of 1.0e-6 which is
set internally in the code.  Epsilon refers to a fraction of the size
of a grid cell in each of its dimensions.  Negative values for any of
the 3 values distances inside a grid cell (inward from the cell face).
Positive values are distances outside a grid cell (outward from the
cell face).  Zero values are exactly on the cell face.  If any surface
point (end points of 2d lines, corner points of 3d triangles) is
between a <I>slo</I> to <I>shi</I> distance from any of the cell faces, then it
is pushed to be a distance <I>svalue</I> from the face.
</P>
<P>When <I>surfpush</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, SPARTA tries 2 kinds of pushing
first, if the numerical issue is encountered for a grid cell.  The
first is <I>slo</I> = -1, <I>shi</I> = 1, <I>svalue</I> = 1, which means any point
within a fractional distance (in each dimension) of 1.0e-6 inside the
cell to 1.0e-6 outside the cell, is shifted to be a distance 1.0e-6
outside the cell.  The second try is with <I>slo</I> = -1, <I>shi</I> = 1,
<I>svalue</I> = 0, which puts the point on the face.  If you set <I>slo</I>,
<I>shi</I>, <I>svalue</I> explicitly, it will be the third option tried.
</P>
<P>If you cannot get a surface to embed properly in a grid, meaning you
get errors with the default setting of <I>surfpush yes</I>, then please
contact the SPARTA developers.  We will want to figure out what is
unusual about your surface file!
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>gridcut</I> keyword determines the cutoff distance at which ghost
grid cells will be stored by each processor.  Assuming the processor
owns a compact clump of grid cells (see below), it will also store
ghost cell information from nearby grid cells, up to this distance
away.  If the setting is -1.0 (the default) then each processor owns a
copy of ghost cells for all grid cells in the simulation.  This can
require too much memory for large models.  If the cutoff is 0.0,
processors own a minimal number of ghost cells.  This saves memory but
may require multiple passes of communication each timestep to move all
the particles and migrate them to new owning processors.  Typically a
cutoff the size of 2-3 grid cell diameters is a good compromise that
requires only modest memory to store ghost cells and allows all
particle moves to complete in only one pass of communication.
</P>
<P>An example of the <I>gridcut</I> cutoff applied to a clumped assignment is
shown in this zoom-in of a 2d hierarchical grid with 5 levels, refined
around a tilted ellipsoidal surface object (outlined in pink).  One
processor owns the grid cells colored orange.  A bounding rectangle
around the orange cells, extended by a short cutoff distance, is drawn
as a purple rectangle.  The rectangle contains only a few ghost grid
cells owned by other processors.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "JPG/partition_zoom_cutoff.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Using the <I>gridcut</I> keyword with a cutoff >= 0.0 is
only allowed if the grid cells owned by each processor are "clumped".
If each processor's grid cells are "dispersed", then ghost cells
cannot be created with a <I>gridcut</I> cutoff >= 0.0.  Whenever ghost
cells are generated, a warning to this effect will be triggered.  At a
later point when surfaces are read in or a simulation is performed, an
error will result.  The solution is to use the
<A HREF = "balance_grid.html">balance_grid</A> command to change to a clumped grid
cell assignment.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 6.8</A> of the
manual for an explanation of clumped and dispersed grid cell
assignments and their relative performance trade-offs.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If grid cells have already been defined via the
<A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A>, <A HREF = "read_grid.html">read_grid</A>, or
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands, when the <I>gridcut</I> cutoff
is specified, then any ghost cell information that is currently stored
will be erased.  As discussed in the preceeding paragraph, a
<A HREF = "balance_grid.html">balance_grid</A> command must then be invoked to
regenerate ghost cell information.  If this is not done before
surfaces are read in or a simulation is performed, an error will
result.
</P>
<P>The <I>comm/sort</I> keyword determines whether the messages a proc
receives for migrating particles (every step) and ghost grid cells (at
setup and after re-balance) are sorted by processor ID.  Doing this
requires a bit of overhead, but can make it easier to debug in
parallel, because simulations should be reproducible when run on the
same number of processors.  Without sorting, messages may arrive in a
randomized order, which means lists of particles and grid cells end up
in a different order leading to statistical differences between runs.
</P>
<P>The <I>comm/style</I> keyword determines the style of particle
communication that is performed to migrate particles every step.  The
most efficient method is typically for each processor to exchange
messages with only the processors it has ghost cells for, which is the
method used by the <I>neigh</I> setting.  The <I>all</I> setting performs a
relatively cheap, but global communication operation to determine the
exact set of neighbors that need to be communicated with at each step.
For small processor counts there is typically little difference.  On
large processor counts the <I>neigh</I> setting can be significantly
faster.  However, if the flow is streaming in one dominant direction,
there may be no particle migration needed to upwind processors, so the
<I>all</I> method can generate smaller counts of neighboring processors.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>neigh</I> style only has an effect (at run time) when the
grid is decomposed by the RCB option of the <A HREF = "balance.html">balance</A> or
<A HREF = "fix_balance.html">fix balance</A> commands.  If that is not the case,
SPARTA performs the particle communication as if the <I>all</I> setting
were in place.
</P>
<P>The <I>weight</I> keyword determines whether particle weighting is used.
Currently the only style allowed, as specified by wstyle = <I>cell</I>, is
per-cell weighting.  This is a mechanism for inducing every grid cell
to contain roughly the same number of particles (even if cells are of
varying size), so as to minimize the total number of particles used in
a simulation while preserving accurate time and spatial averages of
flow quantities.  The cell weights also affect how many particles per
cell are created by the <A HREF = "create_particles.html">create_particles</A> and
<A HREF = "fix_emit_face.html">fix emit</A> command variants.
</P>
<P>If the mode is set to <I>none</I>, per-cell weighting is turned off if it
was previously enabled.  For mode = <I>volume</I> or <I>radius</I>, per-cell
weighting is enabled, which triggers two computations.  First, at the
time this command is issued, each grid cell is assigned a "weight"
which is calculated based either on the cell <I>volume</I> or <I>radius</I>, as
specified by the <I>mode</I> setting.  For the <I>volume</I> setting, the weight
of a cell is its 3d volume for a 3d model, and the weight is its 2d
area for a 2d model.  For an axi-symmetric model, the weight is the 3d
volume of the 2d axi-symmetric cell, i.e. the volume the area sweeps
out when rotated around the y=0 axis of symmetry.  The <I>radius</I>
setting is only allowed for axisymmetric systems.  The weight in this
case is the distance the cell's midpoint is from the y=0 axis of
symmetry.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_2">Section 6.2</A> for more
details on axi-symmetric models.
</P>
<P>Second, when a particle moves from an initial cell to a final cell,
the initial/final ratio of the two cell weights is calculated.  If the
ratio > 1, then additional particles may be created in the final cell,
by cloning the attributes of the incoming particle.  E.g. if the ratio
= 3.4, then two extra particle are created, and a 3rd is created with
probability 0.4.  If the ratio < 1, then the incoming particle may be
deleted.  E.g. if the ratio is 0.7, then the incoming particle is
deleted with probability 0.3.
</P>
<P>Note that the first calculation of weights is performed whenever the
<I>global weight</I> command is issued.  If particles already exist, they
are not cloned or destroyed by the new weights.  The second
calculation only happens when a simulation is run.
</P>
<P>The <I>particle/reorder</I> keyword determines how often the list of
particles on each processor is reordered to store particles in the
same grid cell contiguously in memory.  This operation is performed
every <I>nsteps</I> as specified. A value of 0 means no reordering is ever
done.  This option is only available when using the KOKKOS package and
can improve performance on certain hardware such as GPUs, but is
typically slower on CPUs except when running on thousands of nodes.
</P>
<P>The <I>mem/limit</I> keyword limits the amount of memory allocated for two
operations: load balancing and reordering of particles.  This should
only be necessary for very large simulations where the memory
footprint for particles and grid cells is a significant fraction of
available memory.  In this case, these operations can trigger a memory
error due to the additional memory they require.  Setting a limit on
the memory size will perform these two operations more incrementally
so that memory errors do not occur.
</P>
<P>A load-balance operation can use as much as 3x more memory than the
memory used to store particles (reported by SPARTA when a simulation
begins).  Particle reordering temporarily doubles the memory needed to
store particles because it is performed out-of-place by default.
</P>
<P>Specifying the value for <I>mem/limit</I> as <I>grid</I>, will allocate extra
memory limited to the size of memory for storing grid cells on each
processor.  For most simulations this is typically much smaller than
the memory used to store particles.  Specifying a numeric value for
<I>bytes</I> will allocate extra memory limited to that many MBytes on each
processor.  <I>Bytes</I> can be specified as a floating point value or an
integer, e.g. 0.5 if you want to use 1/2 MByte of extra memory or 100
for a 100 MByte buffer.  Specifying a value of 0 (the default) means
no limit is used.
</P>
<P>For load-balancing, the communication of grid and particle data to new
processors will then be performed in multiple passes (if necessary) so
that only a portion of grid cells and their particles which fit into
the extra memory are migrated in each pass.  Similarly for particle
reordering, multiple passes are performed using the extra memory to
reorder the particles nearly in-place.
</P>
<P>Note that for both operations if the extra memory is too small,
performance will suffer due to the large number of multiple passes
required.
